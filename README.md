# React Notes App

> React note-taking app using `localStorage` and React Router v6

### Overview

App consists of two views: `NoteList` and `NoteForm`.

On `NoteList`, users can view a fetched list of all saved notes. Each note's card links to `NoteForm` with the respective note loaded. Each note's card includes a delete button, which removes the note from `NoteList` and from `localStorage`.

On `NoteForm`, users can edit the text value of a form that loads with the selected note title and body. A back button navigates back to `NoteList`.
